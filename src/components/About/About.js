          My name is Jung Rae Jang also known as JR. Iâ€™m a proud immigrant from
          South Korea. Before joining Pursuit, I worked as a Community Organizer
          for non-profits/New York City government, focusing on issues such as
          immigration and affordable housing. Throughout my work, I realized
          that I had strong passion for creating and making a difference. I
          jumped into the tech industry wishing to combine these two passions.
          In the future, it is my dream to become a developer who works directly
          with Artificial Intelligence.
